Hi, my name is Maximiliano Alegria, I am studying computational math and cryptography at ASU. I welcome you to my GitHub profile!
I will be posting personal projects that I am working on and school projects I have completed.
Most school projects or school-related projects are private due to privacy concerns and academic dishonesty concerns but I can give access if needed and is suitable. 
Feel free to use my content as long as it's not used for financial purposes (you can talk to me if it is for a charitable organization because I will most likely say yes).
