Hi, my name is Maximiliano Alegria. I am a master's student of applied mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. My bachelor's degree was also in mathematics at Arizona State University. I am also a current reservist and aircraft maintainer in the US Air Force. I welcome you to my GitHub profile! 
I will be posting personal projects that I am working on and school projects I have completed. I am mostly trying to gain expertise in Python right now, but I want to become fluent in multiple programming languages as I build my career. 
Hobbies - Lifting heavy things, Triathlon training, learning Japanese, and playing music. I also love video games, but I don't really play them anymore. 
Hit me up if you want to collab on something!
