Hi my name is Maximiliano Alegria, I am studying computational math at ASU. I welcome you to my github profile!
I will be posting personal projects that I am working on and school projects I have completed.
Feel free to use my content as long as its not used for financial purposes (you can talk to me if it is for a charitable organization because I will most likely say yes).
